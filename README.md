### About Me
I am a Computer Engineering and Automatic Control student with a growing passion for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. What started as a curious exploration has quickly turned into a passion, and now I'm actively learning and seeking projects that align with these interests.

### What I'm Learning Right Now
#### Iâ€™m focused on enhancing my skills in:
<br>
* Data Analysis & Visualization
* Machine Learning & AI Algorithms
* Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
* Deep Learning & Neural Networks
**As I progress, Iâ€™m always looking for hands-on projects that challenge my understanding and allow me to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios.**
